# Hi, I'm BM Sampreeth!

Welcome to my personal portfolio.

You might notice this site looks a little different—no colors, no animations, just structure. That's because I built this as a **"Back to Basics" challenge**: create a fully functional, semantic portfolio using **only HTML5** (no CSS or JavaScript allowed).

It’s a demonstration of my ability to write clean, accessible, and well-structured code without relying on styling to make it work.

##  What I'm Working On
I am an AI/ML student passionate about Explainable AI (XAI) and Computer Vision. Here are a few of the projects featured on the site:

* **ToxicDerma-XAI:** My deep learning project for detecting skin lesions. I'm particularly proud of the "Explainable AI" component, which helps doctors understand *why* the model made a prediction.
* **AI Chatbot:** A Python-based bot I built to handle user queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
* **Fake News Detection:** A tool that uses Logistic Regression to classify news articles (Real vs. Fake) with high accuracy.
* **5-Player Ludo:** A fun diversion from AI—I designed the logic and UI for a chaos-filled 5-player version of the classic board game.

##  The "No-Stack" Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic tags only (`<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`).
* **Accessibility:** Built with screen readers in mind (proper alt text and heading hierarchy).

##  How It fits Together
